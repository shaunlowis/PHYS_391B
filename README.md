# PHYS_391B

For now just using this to document my keras installation, since it is scary and I am scared.\
Using this command to install appropriate NVIDIA driver for my rtx3060:\
`sudo apt install nvidia-driver-470`


Apparently the next step is to then go:\
`sudo prime-select nvidia`


Okay so it seems to have worked, now I just need to follow the rest of [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) guide.
